# aws-2025
Collaborators: 
- Ira Dharia: Through this project, I built web application pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while leveraging React with Vite for fast, live updates during development. I also experimented with AWS Amplify and Lambda functions to explore deployment strategies and connect the frontend to backend services. Additionally, we wanted to tell a creative story so I used Stable Diffusion for image generation.
- Emily Tom: I learned to visually identify different music notes and explored the creative capabilities of CSS for keyframe animations and AI to assist in frontend design. I also created detailed mockups for each page, and gained experience writing backend API functionality to connect the interface with real data.
- Nandita Paranjape: Through this project, I learned how to balance full-stack development by integrating a Flask server with a dynamic frontend, while leveraging backend tools like AWS Bedrock, Claude, and the Spotipy library. I gained hands-on experience with prompt engineering, AWS CLI, and building backend functions that generate curated song selections in real time.
